I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. My research focus is computer vision: making computers “see.” I am especially interested in using computer vision to understand the 3D world around the camera, with applications in augmented and virtual reality. I also love applying the "magic" of deep learning to interesting image processing problems in the sciences, such as geography and biology.

Short bio:
===

Dr. Ventura is a native of the central coast of California and earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2012. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from UCSB, as well. Before joining Cal Poly, he was an assistant professor at University of Colorado Colorado Springs. He has also been a postdoctoral researcher with the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision at Graz University of Technology in Austria, in collaboration with Qualcomm Research, and worked as a research intern at the Adobe Advanced Technologies Lab in San Jose, CA. He has presented his work at several top international conferences and journals, including IEEE CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE ISMAR, and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. Joint work with his colleagues has twice been awarded the best paper prize from IEEE ISMAR, the premier international augmented reality conference.  His work has been supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, including an NSF CAREER Award in 2022.
