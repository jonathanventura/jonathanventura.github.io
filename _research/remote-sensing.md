### Individual tree detection in large-scale urban environments using high-resolution multispectral imagery

Systematic maps of urban forests are useful for regional planners and ecologists to understand the spatial distribution of trees in cities. However, manually-created urban forest inventories are expensive and time-consuming to create and typically do not provide coverage of private land. Toward the goal of automating urban forest inventory through machine learning techniques, we performed a comparative study of methods for automatically detecting and localizing trees in multispectral aerial imagery of urban environments, and introduce a novel method based on convolutional neural network regression. Our evaluation is supported by a new dataset of over 1,500 images and almost 100,000 tree annotations, covering eight cities, six climate zones, and three image capture years. To demonstrate the scalability of the technique, we produced the first map of trees across the entire urban forest of California.

### Application of Deep Learning for Classification of Intertidal Eelgrass from Drone-Acquired Imagery

Shallow estuarine habitats are globally undergoing rapid changes due to climate change and anthropogenic influences, resulting in spatiotemporal shifts in distribution and habitat extent. Yet, scientists and managers do not always have rapidly available data to track habitat changes in real-time. In this study, we applied image segmentation techniques to two years of high-resolution drone-based imagery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in the Morro Bay estuary, which has undergone large eelgrass declines and the subsequent recovery of seagrass meadows in the last decade. The model accurately classified eelgrass across a range of conditions and sizes from meadow-scale to small-scale patches that are less than a meter in size. This study demonstrates the potential for machine learning methods to accurately support the active monitoring and analysis of seagrass dynamics.

### Diversity and structure in California’s urban forest: What over six million data points tell us about one of the world's largest urban forests

Urban street trees provide many benefits to surrounding communities, but our ability to assess such benefits relies on the availability of high-quality urban tree data. While these data are numerous, they are not available in an easily accessible, centralized place. To fill this gap, we aggregated public and private data into a single, comprehensive inventory of urban trees in California called the California Urban Forest (CUF) Inventory. This aggregated inventory of one of the world's largest urban forests provides the data necessary to assess the structure, diversity, and value of California’s urban forests at multiple spatial scales.
